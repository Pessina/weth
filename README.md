## Notes

- All the safe operations are only available if the Safe is deployed
  - On a single-sig the Safe is deployed on the first transaction
  - On a multi-sig the Safe has to be manually deployed
- You can only make a proposal and query transactions of a deployed safe (please update the useSafe hook accordingly)
